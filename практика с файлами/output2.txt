ysu sdr  h ucl tig     The harp I yet can brook to hear;
     Its melting murmurs o'er mine ear.
     That sound shall charm it forth again:
     'Twill flow, and cease to burn my brain.
But bid the strain be wild and deep,
I tell thee, minstrel, I must weep,
For it hath been by sorrow nursed,
And now 'tis doomed to know the worst,
