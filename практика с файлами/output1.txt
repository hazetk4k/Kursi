My soul is dark - Oh! quickly string
And let thy gentle fingers fling
If in this heart a hope be dear,
If in these eyes there lurk a tear,

     Nor let thy notes of joy be first:
     Or else this heavy heart will burst;
     And ached in sleepless silence, long;
     And break at once - or yield to song.
